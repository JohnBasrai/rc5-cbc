RC5 Symmetric Block Cipher in Rust

RC5 is a symmetric key block encryption algorithm designed by Ron Rivest in 1994. Notable
for its simplicity and efficiency, RC5 utilizes only primitive computer operations like
XOR and bitwise shifts, making it both fast and memory-efficient. Rust's low-level control
and performance characteristics make it an ideal language for implementing this algorithm.
The original algorithmic details can be found in Rivest's seminal paper: The RC5
Encryption Algorithm

Original Paper: The RC5 Encryption Algorithm by Ron Rivest, published in the ACM
Transactions on Computer Systems, provides the comprehensive algorithmic specification and
design principles behind the RC5 symmetric block cipher.
