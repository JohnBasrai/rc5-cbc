# rc5-cbc
RC5 Symmetric Block Cipher in Rust

RC5 is a symmetric key block encryption algorithm designed by Ron Rivest in 1994. It is
notable for being simple, fast (on account of using only primitive computer operations
like XOR, shift, etc.) and consumes less memory.  Making Rust an idle language to
implement it in.

Rivest original paper is [The RC5 Encryption Algorithm](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv94.pdf)
